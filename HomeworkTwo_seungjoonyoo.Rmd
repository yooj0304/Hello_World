This is my R Markdown document for HomeworkOne submitted last week. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

From the first assignment, I was asked to choose one of the three datasets and show the first few rows of data in the console. Out of three, I chose the *congressional_hearings* dataset. This time, I used **head ()** function instead of **print ()** as recommended in the previous comment.

```{r}
myData <- read_excel("congressional_hearings.csv.xlsx")
myTibble <- as_tibble(myData)
head (myTibble)
```

In order to check the number of observations and the number of variables, I used the codes below. It shows that there are **100,254 observations** and **36 variables** in the congressional_hearings dataset. Some of the variables include sequence, month, congress, year, comittee, and referral.

```{r}
dim(myTibble)
colnames(myTibble)
```
